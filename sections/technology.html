	                        	In addition to the experiance that I have gained through work and my degree, I have also worked on a veriety
	                        	of personal projects in my free time. I have installed and used several Linux distributions, including Ubuntu,
	                        	Red Hat, and Gentoo. On all of these systems I have installed and configured MySQL and Apache. I have worked 
	                        	with Amazon's cloud platforms, especily S3, RDS, and EC2. I also have a few projects that use Arduino and 
	                        	RaspberryPi.

	                    		I always have a number of on going programing projects that are for my own personal use and enrichment. 
	                    		You can find the code for most of these projects on my GitHub profile page (<a href="https://github.com/dapuck">https://github.com/dapuck</a>).
	                    		My most active projects on GitHub use Node.js. I find coding for Node.js very enjoyable, especialy given my
	                    		experiance with JavaScript.
