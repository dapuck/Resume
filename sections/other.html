	                        <p class="noprint">
	                            As part of one of my Interprofesional Projects (IPro), at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), I
	                            served as a Development Manager. The project was called Teacher Knowledge Share, the goal was to create 
	                            as social/professional networking site for teachers in the Chicagoland area. The hope was that it would 
	                            become a place for teachers to share advice and collaborate on lesson plans and teaching activities.

	                            Part of my duties as a Development Manager included managing a small team of software developers in creating
	                            the website, including making hosting and architecture decisions. I also worked with people from different 
	                            disciplines to help solicit requirements from our target audience. After the initial build of the website 
	                            was completed, we created a multimedia web survey to get feedback about the site from our target audience.

	                        <p>
	                            In 2010 I had the good fortune to go to the 2010 National Scout Jamboree as a volunteer on the Computer
	                            Support Staff. The Computer support staff worked in small teams to provide IT support over a large area,
	                            with a primary focus on supporting computer systems for medical staff in the field. As part of the 
	                            Computer Support Staff, I assisted in IT asset distribution and collection. We also worked to keep the 
	                            computer systems operating in the high heat and humidity of Virginia in August.
