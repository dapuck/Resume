                            	At Where 2 Get It, I work on bug fixes and new features for our front-end systems written
                            	in JavaScript and HTML, our Perl back-end, and our PostgreSQL database. I have also written custom JavaScript 
                            	code to meet client requirements, as well as putting together development time estimates 
                            	for client requests. Part of my duties as Manager of Technical Operations includes integrating
                            	code written by our core group of developers as well as contract developers, and deploying code
                            	to our Staging and Production environments.
                            </p>

                            	Some of my more noteable accomplishments at Where 2 Get It have been the creation of a set of JavaScript 
                            	libraries for the mobile locator, creating a contract building system, a simple photo gallery generator, 
                            	and a set of scripts to automate code deployment.

	                            Durring my time at Model Metrics I primarily used the ETL (Extract Transform Load) tool, Talend, to
	                            do complex data migrations and integrations for clients. I also worked on enhancements to internal tools, 
	                            written in PHP, that analyzed the quality of clients' data in salesforce.com. One of those enhancemanets was
	                            to improve report generation speed by developing a way to generate the pages of the report in parallel.
